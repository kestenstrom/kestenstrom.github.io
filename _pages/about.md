I am a MA Candidate in the [Department of Linguistics](https://www.neiu.edu/academics/college-of-arts-and-sciences/departments/linguistics) at Northeastern Illinois University. 

My research interests are in experimental semantics and pragmatics, focusing on the interpretations of presupposition in the scope of attitude verbs. I am also interested in the syntax-semantics interface.

I am affiliated with Ariana Bancu's [Trilingualism Lab](https://bancuariana.wixsite.com/website/about-3).
